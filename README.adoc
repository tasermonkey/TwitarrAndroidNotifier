= TwitarrNotifier

This is a very fast sample project of making notifications in the Android ecosystem against a Twitarr instance.

See https://github.com/walkeriniraq/twitarr[Twitarr Github] page for more information on that.

Why not using https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html[Google Cloud Messaging(GCM)] instead of polling?

Because on the Cruise (the entire point of Twitarr) we don't have access to the internet.

== Warning

The use of this android app will probably decrease your battery life a bunch.  Especially at its default setting of polling every 20 seconds :-)
